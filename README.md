## K-Means Clustering

**Data Set:**

[Dataset](https://github.com/chxtio/CSE-575-Statistical-Machine-Learning/blob/master/Assignment%202-%20K-Means%20Clustering/AllSamples.npy)

The algorithm was applied on a data set of 300 2-D sample points.

**Implementation:**

The K-Means algorithm performs clustering on the given data with the number K of clusters ranging from 2-10.
The objective function as a function of k (k = 2, 3, â€¦, 10) was computed as follows:

where k = number of clusters, n = number of cases, j = the index of cluster to which sample xi is currently assigned, and cj = centroid
of the cluster to which xi has been assigned.

**Strategies:**<br/>
Two strategies were implemented for choosing the initial cluster centers.

Strategy 1: randomly pick the initial centers from the given samples.

Strategy 2: pick the first center randomly; for the i-th center (i>1), choose a sample (among all possible samples) such that the average
Euclidian distance of this chosen one to all previous (i-1) centers is maximal.

An example of strategy 2's initialization of centroids is illustrated for K = 10.
